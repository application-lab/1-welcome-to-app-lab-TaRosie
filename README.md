# Assignment 1: Welcome to App Lab
## About Me

Hi, my name is Haoyu Gao, and I use **Rosie** most as my preferred name in field.
I am from Chengdu, China, and current I am an IMA (Interactive Media Arts major) junior at NYU Shanghai. This writing is for the Applications Lab class taught by Christian Grewell and Oliver Steele in fall 2019.
I have done some projects and creations, both individual and in group, digital or physical in some previous IMA classes I have taken using tools like Arduino, Processing, MAYA, MUDBOX, Rhino, Adobe Illustrator, or just simple coding in HTML and Javascript. For interests, I am also doing some creative writings including screenplays (in English), short stories and poems (in Chinese). 
I am interested in game and stage design from writing to visual designs. My personal favorite is *Alice: Madness Returns* produced by Shanghai Spicy Horse Studio. I am still exploring my career path as a creator and collaborator, working to improve my programming skills so that I can create more fun stuff using different technologies. I love to work with people from different fields with diverse personalities.
My personal profoliio page is still in building. I will make sure to update it here after I finish. :blush:
